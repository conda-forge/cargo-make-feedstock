  summary: 'Rust task runner and build tool.'
  description: |
    The cargo-make task runner enables to define and configure sets of tasks and run them as a flow.
    A task is a command, script, rust code, or other sub tasks to execute.
    Tasks can have dependencies which are also tasks that will be executed before the task itself.
    With a simple toml based configuration file, you can define a multi platform build script that
    can run build, test, generate documentation, run bench tests, run security validations and more,
    executed by running a single command.
